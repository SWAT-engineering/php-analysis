 *  long and contain letters, numbers, and symbols.
 *
 * - key    - Encryption key used to do encryption and decryption. The default option
 *           should never be used for a production website.
 *
 *  [!!] Do not use a hash as your key. This significantly lowers encryption entropy.
 *
 * - mode   - MCrypt encryption mode. By default, MCRYPT_MODE_NOFB is used. This mode
 *           offers initialization vector support, is suited to short strings, and
 *           produces the shortest encrypted output.
 *
 * - cipher - MCrypt encryption cipher. By default, the MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_128 cipher is used.
 *           This is also known as 128-bit AES.
 *
 * 	For more information about mcrypt modes and cipers see the [mcrypt php docs](http://php.net/mcrypt).

 "/**
 * API for Gallery Access control.
 *
 * Permissions are hierarchical, and apply only to groups and albums.  They cascade down from the
 * top of the Gallery to the bottom, so if you set a permission in the root album, that permission
 * applies for any sub-album unless the sub-album overrides it.  Likewise, any permission applied
 * to an album applies to any photos inside the album.  Overrides can be applied at any level of
 * the hierarchy for any permission other than View permissions.
 *
 * View permissions are an exceptional case.  In the case of viewability, we want to ensure that
 * if an album\'s parent is inaccessible, then this album must be inaccessible also.  So while view
 * permissions cascade downwards and you\'re free to set the ALLOW permission on any album, that
 * ALLOW permission will be ignored unless all that album\'s parents are marked ALLOW also.
 *
 * Implementatation Notes:
 *
 * Notes refer to this example album hierarchy:
 *      A1
 *     /  \
 *   A2   A3
 *       /  \
 *      A4  A5
 *
 * o We have the concept of \"intents\".  A user can specify that he intends for A3 to be
 *   inaccessible (ie: a DENY on the \"view\" permission to the EVERYBODY group).  Once A3 is
 *   inaccessible, A5 can never be displayed to that group.  If A1 is made inaccessible, then the
 *   entire tree is hidden.  If subsequently A1 is made accessible, then the whole tree is
 *   available again *except* A3 and below since the user\'s \"intent\" for A3 is maintained.
 *
 * o Intents are specified as <group_id, perm, item_id> tuples.  It would be inefficient to check
 *   these tuples every time we want to do a lookup, so we use these intents to create an entire
 *   table of permissions for easy lookup in the Access_Cache_Model.  There\'s a 1:1 mapping
 *   between Item_Model and Access_Cache_Model entries.
 *
 * o For efficiency, we create columns in Access_Intent_Model and Access_Cache_Model for each of
 *   the possible Group_Model and Permission_Model combinations.  This may lead to performance
 *   issues for very large Gallery installs, but for small to medium sized ones (5-10 groups, 5-10
 *   permissions) it\'s especially efficient because there\'s a single field value for each
 *   group/permission/item combination.
 *
 * o For efficiency, we store the cache columns for view permissions directly in the Item_Model.
 *   This means that we can filter items by group/permission combination without doing any table
 *   joins making for an especially efficient permission check at the expense of having to
 *   maintain extra columns for each item.
 *
 * o If at any time the Access_Cache_Model becomes invalid, we can rebuild the entire table from
 *   the Access_Intent_Model
